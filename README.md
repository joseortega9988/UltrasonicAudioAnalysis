# Ultrasonic Audio Analysis

A script that identifies which of the three audio files have a secret message in ultrasonic frequencies

**To run the program, just upload the code in any enviormente jupyter notebooks can run**


#### Important information 
 
You need thinkdsp.py installed on the directory for this script to work


## Porpuse of the Script

A company has tasked me with creating a Python script that involves the analysis of a set of suspicious audio files (sound2.wav, sound3.wav, and sound4.wav) to identify the one containing a hidden four-digit secret code. In this scenario, the audio file with the hidden message employs amplitude modulation to shift the secret code into an ultrasonic frequency range.

Once the script identifies the audio file with the hidden message, it converts that particular file to play the secret code within an audible range of frequencies.

For more details of how it works please see the comments on the code.
