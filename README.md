#### Important informatiion 
 
You need thinkdsp.py installed on the directory for this file to work



## Porpuse of the Script

A company commissioned me to develop a Python script capable of extracting and deciphering concealed messages from an audio file they provided. This file conceals confidential information using the LSB audio steganography technique, which is a prevalent method in audio steganography that involves concealing secret data within the least significant bit (LSB) of an audio file.

For more details of how it works please see the comments on the code.
